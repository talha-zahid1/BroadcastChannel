## ðŸš€ Features
- Multiple clients can connect to the server.
- Messages from one client are broadcasted to all connected clients.
- Proper handling of client connections and disconnections.
- Uses Java threads for concurrent client communication.
## Technologies Used
- *Java* (Sockets, Multithreading)
- *OOP Concepts*
- *Client-Server Architecture*
## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- Server.java â†’ Starts the server and listens for clients.
- Client.java â†’ Connects to the server and sends/receives messages.
